# ChessSudoku

This program is a sudoku solver which solves any sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm and recursion. In addition, it implements a chess rule(Knight, Queen, King) into the game, which limits the number of solutions available based on the rule. 

Ex. King rule: There cannot be an overlapping solution within the 1-block range.
